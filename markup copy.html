    <h1>Notes on Writing Science Fiction and Fantasy</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">
        <p>Lecture series by Brandon Sanderson</p>
        <p>with help from Brandon Mull</p>
        <p>Brigham Young University 318R</p>
        <p>https://youtu.be/N4ZDBOc2tX8</p>
    </div>

    <div class="overview">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Box contains the story. The story is plot, setting, and character tied together by conflict. The prose is a window where readers can look into the box.</p>
        <p>You will work your whole life on making better boxes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>I. Character</h2>
    <p>Cook up characters the reader will relate to, and make everything you write show the characters' motivations.</p>

    <h2>II. Setting</h2>
    <p>Create a place filled with things you're passionate about and magic that provides wonder and awesomeness without being <em>deus ex machina</em>.</p>

    <h2>III. Plot</h2>
    <p>Start with a character who wants something, then continually make promises to the reader and fulfill them in surprising yet inevitable ways.</p>

    <h2>IV. Prose</h2>
    <p>Create a pane of glass that colors everything in the story with the narrative type, the characters' motivations, and your voice as an author.</p>

    <h2>V. Business</h2>
    <p>After writing a work of passion, exploit the work for money by researching agents/editors who would like it, and sending them well-crafted pitches.</p>

    <div class="note">
        <p>This is a class to give tools for beginning writers to use, not rules to follow. Your homework is to go write.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Character</h2>
    <p>A writer makes people care about things that never happened, spinning gold out of straw. (Mull) You do this by making readers relate to the characters.</p>

    <h3>Five ways to make relatable characters:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The character is everyman. Reader sees themselves as the character.</li>
        <li>The character is superman/highly competent. Reader wishes they could be character.</li>
        <li>The character must want something strongly enough that the reader also wants it. (Mull)</li>
        <li>The character must create emotional reaction in the reader (laughter, hatred, etc.) and then characters will be real to the reader. (Mull)</li>
        <li>The character must have relationships (family, romance, mentor, friend, etc.) If the characters matter to each other, they matter to the reader. (Mull)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Need a little of each in every character.</p>

    <h3>Being nerdy means taking weird, imaginary things and treating them authentically. This reveals truth that reality cannot show. (Mull)</h3>

    <h3>Cooking up characters takes a real chef:</h3>
    <h4>Build characters with three sliding scales:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Likeability</li>
        <li>Competence</li>
        <li>Proactivity</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <p>To make a character likeable, have another character say why they like them.</p>
        <p>Shift sliders during story. Foreshadow these shifts.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Superman vs Scrooge</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Superman: character accomplishes things.</li>
        <li>Scrooge: character changes themselves.</li>
        <li>Each character needs some of both.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Characters must overcome flaws and handicaps:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Handicaps (things that are not their fault, or out of their control)</li>
        <li>Flaws (things that are their fault)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Take character tropes and mix and match:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>e.g. mentor who is also the villain, funny sidekick who is also the muscle, loyal friend who is also the chosen one.</li>
        <li>Mismatched characteristics can be good: e.g. mortician who is afraid of the dead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dossiers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Look up dossiers of characters that writers use.</li>
        <li>Write a monologue based on a dossier to create a character.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>You don't have to "know thirteen-year-old girls" to write about one. No one knows them, not even thirteen-year-old girls. You only have to know the girl you're writing about. (Mull)</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Characters go wrong when:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They are a result of being built to suit a story, rather than having life outside of it.</li>
        <li>The reader doesn't know what the motivation is.</li>
        <li>Sexism/Racism</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Understand these issues.</p>
        <p>Don't write women as objects, obviously.</p>
        <p>But don't overcorrect by making them awesome in every way.</p>
        <p>Write fully developed characters who are women/minorities, but not just one!</p>
        <p>Give all characters quirks, archs, dreams etc.</p>
        <p>We all make these mistakes. It's a simple writing mistake with writing bad characters. Don't react angrily if someone says your writing is racist. You're not racist; you're just making writing mistakes that make your writing racist.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Your descriptions of the world should also describe characters. Every line should do multiple things.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Do exercise: write out how different characters would describe the same thing.</li>
        <li>Relevant especially for first person and third person limited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Five ways to use characters as filters through which reader sees the world (P.R.O.M.S.):</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Past</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Characters do not pop into existence when the story starts. Every character has things in the past that will shape who they are.</li>
                <li>Things in story will remind characters of past.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Relationships</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Relationships are foundation of most stories</li>
                <li>Spend majority of story with 2-3 characters interacting in interesting ways.</li>
                <li>Convey how people feel about each other through:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the way they describe the world</li>
                        <li>the way they engage in dialogue</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Let it color every line of description, even un-obvious things.</li>
                <li>Actions should convey personality and relationships.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Obligations</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Social constructs, culture</li>
                <li>e.g. Koreans do not show bottom of foot to one another; must show courtesy even to those they don't like.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Motivations</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Losing sight of motivation is prime reason for characters to be stilted.</li>
                <li>e.g. character says something to move plot along, but reader doesn't know why that character would say it</li>
                <li>e.g. character belabors a point, but reader doesn't understand enough about character to care</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Sensibilities</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Unique brain chemistry that makes a character see things in a different way</li>
                <li>e.g. when a character sees pencils: "Ooo, I want to draw something!" vs. "One of them is pointed the wrong way."</li>
                <li>Passions/Likes/dislikes: e.g. a dog person describing a dog would be different than a cat person describing a dogâ€¦ or a starving person during the war.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Setting (World Building)</h2>
    <h3>Learning curve:</h3>
    <h4>The iceberg:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>People want to be immersed in a new place.</li>
        <li>Your job is to convince the reader that even a character's underwear is part of a different world.</li>
        <li>Make sure you don't show the whole iceberg too soon.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Reader eventually becomes an expert in your world:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose how steep your curve is. Readers like learning the things, places, characters, etc. unless they become overwhelmed.</li>
        <li>It's ok to confuse your readers, just have a character say, "Hey, this is confusing," to give the reader permission to be confused.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Bring out the characters first:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Then gradually introduce the world and the larger story.</li>
        <li>World building should not be at expense of character, but hopefully you do all three things well.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Maid and Butler dialogue:</h4>
    <p>When characters talk about the plot/setting without having a reason to do so. Avoid this.</p>

    <h3>There is the physical world and the cultural world:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Find something to build in the cultural world besides just weapons, language, history.</li>
        <li>Economics, education, jobs, lawsâ€¦ something to set your book apart.</li>
        <li>Don't take too many English classes. Learn about what you're most passionate to use in your stories.</li>
        <li>No need to be an expert in every area you write about. But read up on it a little and have an expert critique it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>We're good at combining things, not making things up entirely:</h3>
    <p>A unicorn is just a horse with a horn. Be careful when borrowing things from our world.</p>

    <h4>Don't use strawmen:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't have something that's not the Catholic Church but is exactly like the Catholic Church and they're all evil.</li>
        <li>Don't have one religious person who is always an idiot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Magic systems</h3>
    <p>Good magic systems have rules. But reader doesn't need to know or understand all the rules. So it's a mixture: avoid <em>deus ex machina</em> but also provide a sense of wonder.</p>

    <h4>Tolkien is a mixture:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ring: rules are it makes you invisible, but Sauron can see you.</li>
        <li>Gandalf: not really sure what his rules are...</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Brandon's four laws of writing magic:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Law #1:</strong> Your ability to solve problems with magic in a satisfying way is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic.
            <ul>
                <li>If magic isn't being used to solve problems, then the magic doesn't need rules the reader understands. Then magic creates sense of awe, wonder, or fear.</li>
                <li>If magic solves problems, it needs to follow satisfying plot/foreshadowing; that "Aha!" moment when the reader says "I should've seen it!"</li>
                <li>When heroes win, it needs to feel earned.</li>
                <li>Hard magic system vs. soft magic system:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hard magic: rules are explained and repeatable. Isn't scientific, but dependable. Limitations make things exciting. Rules can be stretched if it happens in a satisfying way, but not broken. Don't say your system is hard and then push it gradually towards soft.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Law #2:</strong> Flaws are more interesting than powers.
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on what magic can't do. A good character must be tested in ways they are not prepared for.</li>
                <li>Ways to make magic limited:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cost. Connect magic to something else: Economic, moral, mental, physical cost.</li>
                        <li>Can fly, but only ten feet high.</li>
                        <li>Telekinetic, but only with metal objects.</li>
                        <li>Unintended consequences.</li>
                        <li>Only works every other Tuesday.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Law #3:</strong> Go deeper into a magic system, not wider
            <ul>
                <li>A few things that are well explored will feel cooler than a large number of things that are shallow.</li>
                <li>e.g. Two magical races that have a deep relationship is better than twenty that each have only one gimmick.</li>
                <li>Consider always leaving holes in system to give sense of wonder.</li>
                <li>Characters are themselves discovering more about the magic system.</li>
                <li>Start at 75% hard magic, giving yourself wiggle room as story progresses.</li>
                <li>But if your reader needs a spreadsheet to keep track of magic, simplify.</li>
                <li>Magic should have elegant powers and elegant limitations.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Law #0:</strong> Always err on the side of what is AWESOME!!!
            <ul>
                <li>Because does Brandon actually follow these laws? Not exactly.</li>
                <li>Fantasy/sci-fi is ultimately about saying "Aaaaahhhhh that was AWESOME!"</li>
                <li>Stick with the original, awesome idea you're passionate about, and use these laws as tools to create an exciting story.</li>
                <li>e.g. "Scotty is an awesome genius who can solve any technical problem" can be an ok magic system if you add "BUT we need to buy him five minutes of time."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. Plot</h2>
    <h3>A great plot will:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Make promises.</li>
        <li>Fulfill those promises in a surprising, yet satisfying and inevitable way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Two different styles to writing plots:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Discovery writer:</strong> creates characters and sees where they go as they write.
            <ul>
                <li>Discovery may feel exciting at first.</li>
                <li>Easier to write a good middle.</li>
                <li>May have lame endings.</li>
                <li>May need lots of revision.</li>
                <li>Should try stopping 2/3 before end of book and take stock of what promises you've made and how to fulfill them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Outline writer:</strong> makes an outline of story before writing book.
            <ul>
                <li>Easier to write a good ending.</li>
                <li>May end up feeling wooden.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Both are ok. You decide.</p>
        <p>Brandon is an outline writer for plot and setting, but a discovery writer for character.</p>
        <p>Just don't get bogged down in rewriting your beginning chapters or your outline before forging ahead and finishing the book.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>A Recipe for a Plot:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Decide if the story will primarily be:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Characters vs. setting</li>
                <li>Characters vs. characters</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Start with a hook</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>A hook is a character who wants something.</li>
                <li>Getting the reader/editor to read past the first page isn't about your awesome plot or big ideas, but:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Doing world-building without info-dumping.</li>
                        <li>Doing viewpoint and voice that is engaging and evocative.</li>
                        <li>Introducing conflict/motion/something going wrong.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Characters are the reason readers keep reading.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Plot frameworks:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Three Acts</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Act one</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introduction: setting, tone, character setup</li>
                        <li>Crisis point: point of no return for protagonist</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Act two</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Things get worse</li>
                        <li>Protagonist tries things but fails</li>
                        <li>Low point</li>
                        <li>Do or die moment</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Act three</strong>

    <h3>Plot has three parts: beginning, middle, end</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Beginning</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Characters, premise can hook you, but those are really part of the promise.
                    <ul>
                        <li>e.g. promise that this story will be important to relatable characters you care about.</li>
                        <li>e.g. funny banter promises the book will make you laugh.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>An interesting premise promises you will be amazed/horrified, etc.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Must choose at beginning how strange/familiar story will feel. Can't change too much throughout book.</li>
                        <li>e.g. <em>I Am Not a Serial Killer</em> is flawed because it doesn't promise to be a supernatural monster book, but it is.</li>
                        <li>At least give hints.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Middle</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Always be fulfilling promises.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Middle is hardest but also most important. A cool ending isn't enough. The middle shows how the ending has been earned.</li>
                        <li>Every chapter has to be interesting</li>
                        <li>Usually when people say the plot was interesting, they mean the pacing was good.</li>
                        <li>Twists and turns are not the hallmark of a good plot; promises are.</li>
                        <li>If you are never fulfilling promises in a fulfilling way, the promise you are making is that the reader will never get fulfillment.</li>
                        <li>So withhold less than you think you need to.</li>
                        <li>Spread out awesomeness throughout story.</li>
                        <li>Discovery has to be as interesting as the question.</li>
                        <li>You need to build trust with the reader by fulfilling promises.</li>
                        <li>Established authors can get away with more, since they've built trust.</li>

                        <li>You're constantly opening brackets and closing brackets, like a huge math problem.</li>
                        <li>Brackets within brackets{...[...]...[...(...)...]...}</li>
                        <li>Nesting plot cycles: some success along the way, with complete resolution while other plot cycles are continuing.</li>
                        <li>Promises are fulfilled through plot cycles.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If your middle seems pointless, it's because you're ignoring the idea of change.</li>
                        <li>At the end of every chapter, you should be able to say what has changed.</li>

                <li>Hardest thing as a writer is picking which scene to show, and what to skip through. (Mull)

                <li>Readers need to experience progress.

    <h3>Endings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All promises are fulfilled.</li>
        <li>Must feel surprising, yet inevitable and satisfying.</li>
        <li>Can't hold out too much hope for multiple possible endings.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <p>e.g. <em>Trueblood</em> series left most readers unsatisfied because there were too many possible love interests for the protagonist. Most readers were disappointed because she didn't choose their favorite suitor. <em>Twilight</em> was more satisfying because there were only two suitors, and her choice was foreshadowed.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Writer's block</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Saying you have writer's block is like telling the doctor you have a headache. There are many possible causes/solutions.</li>
        <li>There are two main causes:
            <ul>
                <li>Something is fundamentally wrong with the story, and I can't continue to write this character without changing everything. But this is rareâ€¦ 1:100. Don't assume this is the case.</li>
                <li>Other times it's just a bad day - feeling cruddy about life for some reason. Imposter syndrome. Or just don't feel like writing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Get beyond it and write anyway. Write badly, but write.</li>
        <li>Write SOMETHING. Have ninjas attack. Change viewpoint. Change location. Make something go wrong you weren't planning on.</li>
        <li>Write a monologue from a character about their motivations.</li>
        <li>9/10 times you do this, you'll realize it doesn't suck. Trust your skills, not your mood.</li>
        <li>Even if it does suck, you'll see how to fix it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Prose</h2>
    <div class="quote">
        <p>"Prose is the panel of glass through which you see the story." - George Orwell</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Prose is the window the reader looks through to see the story inside of the box.</li>
        <li>Prose is how you color everything in the story.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Three types of narratives:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>First person</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Need to focus on what the narrator is actually focusing on.</li>
                <li>Immediately immersive.</li>
                <li>Focus on main character.</li>
                <li>Voice is very natural.</li>
                <li>Building sympathy is easy.</li>
                <li>Easy to have an untrustworthy narrator.</li>
                <li>You can address the audience.</li>
                <li>Not great for immersing reader in a large world.</li>
                <li>Default for YA fiction.</li>
                <li>Types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Memoir</li>
                        <li>Epistolary â€“ novel made up of letters. Today's books use text messages, blog posts, etc.</li>
                        <li>Cinematic first person:
                            <ul>
                                <li>No direct audience</li>
                                <li>As if you're right in their head</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Hybrid: narrator who is somewhat omniscient
                            <ul>
                                <li>Begins like, "Let me tell you the story ofâ€¦"</li>
                                <li>Lots of classic books use this</li>
                                <li>Drawback is it removes tension: you know the narrator survives.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Unlimited/omniscient third person</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Can narrate viewpoints from any character.</li>
                <li>It's omniscient if you ever say, "But little did he knowâ€¦"</li>
                <li>Difficult because it seems strange when there's a character whose viewpoint you don't narrate. How do you choose which viewpoints to show?</li>
                <li>You create suspense because the reader knows something is going to happen. e.g. the reader knows who the traitor is.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Third person limited:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Story is related through one person's viewpoint.</li>
                <li>Create suspense because the reader doesn't know what will happen.</li>
                <li>Default for epic fantasy.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Second person basically doesn't exist</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Used in choose-your-own-adventure books.</li>
                <li>If used, should not be just a gimmick.</li>
                <li>Done well very infrequently.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="note">
        <p>First person and third person limited are your main tools.</p>
        <p>The trick is to learn either FP or TPL to show plot, character, settingâ€¦ without showing plot, character, setting.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Don't dump info. Convey information in a fun way.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Show from character's viewpoint in a scene; don't show anything else
            <ul>
                <li>Do not write: "Earl came into the room."</li>
                <li>Write: "He heard the door slam, and thenâ€¦ footsteps."</li>
                <li>Establish character has blindspots</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Make reader say "This character is an idiot, I hope they get better." Not "This character is an idiot, I'm going to put the book down."</p>
        <p>Make it so reader doesn't notice the idiocy right away, and then another character points it out later.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Goal is not to describe everything, but give essential information with flavor</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Describe one stark, concrete detail and allowing reader to paint in the rest is better word painting than describing the entire room.</li>
        <li>e.g. "Bullet holes in window" allows readers to evoke the wider setting of the room.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Story can have lots of viewpoints.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Harder to have untrustworthy narrator.</li>
        <li>You want every viewpoint to feel distinct.</li>
        <li>But can have some similarities, same author's style.</li>
        <li>World is directly colored by each characters view.</li>
        <li>Omniscient: smooth narration, except punctuated by thought bubbles from various characters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tense</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose present or past tense and stay consistent.</li>
        <li>The two are very similar. Reader doesn't pay much attention to it.</li>
        <li>YA standard is present tense.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Voice is most important thing to have as a writer. (Mull)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Agents mostly look for voice.</li>
        <li>Voice is what you sound like as a storyteller.</li>
        <li>The music you hear that you think storytelling should sound like.</li>
        <li>You don't get paid for your story, but how you tell it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>But don't worry too much about how to develop voice.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It will come out of what you have read and what you like in writing.</li>
        <li>What kind of prose do you like?</li>
        <li>What do you like about them?</li>
        <li>How do they enhance the story?</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Hallmarks of your voice will come so easily it will even be frustrating.</p>
        <p>You may notice you use a certain adjective too often. In Word, use search and replace to highlight all instances of the word, and scroll through to see if you want to replace some with a different word.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Translucent vs. stained glass</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Orwell makes prose as translucent as possible.</li>
        <li>Some write like a stain glass window. It may distract from the story, but that can be ok to some extent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dialogue: M.I.C.R.O.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Motive</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Good dialogue keeps attention on what the character wants in life</li>
                <li>Number one cause of stilted dialogue is because there is only explanation, not motives.</li>
                <li>Everything must come from a character's motive, even when you need to info-dump to explain something.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Individuality</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Should tell characters apart even without dialogue tags.</li>
                <li>Easy, and easily overdone ways of varying characters' dialogue:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dialect
                            <ul>
                                <li>A large number of readers will just skip over dialect</li>
                                <li>Dialect can easily become a gross stereotype</li>
                                <li>You can just sprinkle it in instead</li>
                                <li>Or have other characters basically repeat what was said in dialect to make it understood</li>
                                <li>Even Chewbacca and R2D2 can be understood through other characters</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Word choice

                                <li>But, for example, intelligent people don't actually use bigger words in normal conversation</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                </li>
                <li>Stronger ways to vary dialogue:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some are more aggressive vs. circumspect in conversation</li>
                        <li>How excited do they get?</li>
                        <li>Varying sentence size</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Motive and individuality are most important parts of dialogue.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Conflict</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Every dialogue section has conflict.</li>
                <li>Doesn't mean argument necessarily.</li>
                <li>Must be tension in everything in the book.</li>
                <li>e.g. someone is too busy to talk. Trying to get info in roundabout way. No mutual trust. One person is impatient with how far behind another is. One isn't picking up on social cues.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Realistic vs. elevated dialogue</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Decide how realistic you want dialogue to be and aim for that</li>
                <li>Writing realistic dialogue exactly like people talk can be grating e.g. full of "ummms" and pauses etc.</li>
                <li>Elevated/Shakespearean:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a tradition in dialogue where we pretend people are more eloquent than they actually are.</li>
                        <li>e.g. Joss Whedon's constantly witty characters</li>
                        <li>Too elevated can feel overwhelming for reader.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Choose a goal in between to aim for.</li>
                <li>Shifting a scene to more realistic dialogue can help with relatability.</li>
                <li>Test audiences can help.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Objective</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Every scene must achieve a goal set by the author.</li>
                <li>e.g. characters must argue about decision to make, thus advancing the plot; two characters meet for romantic liaison, thus advancing their relationship; or we need to explain why dragons from Venus are eating cars.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

        <p>Authors who can write great dialogue usually do better than those who write great narrative.</p>

    <h3>Pyramid of Abstraction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bulk of writing should be concrete (bottom of the pyramid). Concrete language grounds reader in a scene. Then you can start to get abstract (top of pyramid).</li>
        <li>Don't want reader to drift away too far up the pyramid.</li>
        <li>Not too much navel-gazing.</li>
        <li>Strong writing pulls reader to bottom of pyramidâ€¦ to an extent.</li>
        <li>"Dog" is still an abstract idea. "A wet mangey poodle wallowed in a puddle" is concrete.</li>
        <li>Show, don't tell.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
        <p>Experience is more powerful and memorable than telling about something.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not say: "Earl was a tall man."</li>
            <li>Do say: "Earl ducked under the doorframe as he entered the room."</li>
            <li>Do not say: "Earl was a nervous man."</li>
            <li>Do say: "Earl quickly paced the room."</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>Reduce telling by showing, or delete it entirely.</li>
        <li>But telling has a purpose. Use telling to pass time to get to the next actionâ€¦ e.g. skip to a scene three weeks later when the next important revelation happens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Describe all five senses characters are experiencing to pull down on pyramid.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Of all the senses, taste is hard. Don't let your characters lick things.</li>
    </ul>
